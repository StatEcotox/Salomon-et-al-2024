Effects of dissolved organic matter on the toxicity of micro- and nanoplastic particles to *Daphnia* - a meta-analysis. *Microplastics and Nanoplastics*. ([https://doi.org/](https://doi.org/))**


*Abstract*

Effects of micro- and nanoplastic particles (MNP) on organisms have been increasingly reported in recent years, with a large number of studies conducted on water fleas of the genus *Daphnia*. Most of the available studies used pristine particles that have not been exposed to the environment or to organic substances. In natural environments, however, organic substances like dissolved organic matter (DOM) attach to the MNP, forming an ecocorona on the particles’ surface. How the formation of an ecocorona influences MNP toxicity is still uncertain. While some studies suggest that DOM can mitigate the negative effects of MNP on organisms, other studies did not find such associations. In addition, it is unclear whether the DOM attached to the particles’ surface is attenuating the effects of MNP directly or whether co-exposure with DOM solved in the medium attenuates MNP toxicity indirectly, for instance by increasing Daphnia‘s resilience to stressors in general. To draw more solid conclusions about the direction and size of the mediating effect of DOM on MNP-associated immobilization in *Daphnia* spp., we synthesized evidence from the published literature and compiled 305 data points from 13 independent studies. The results of our meta-analysis show that the toxic effects of MNP are likely reduced in the presence of certain types of DOM in the exposure media. We found similar mediating effects when MNP were incubated in media containing DOM before the exposure experiments, although to a lesser extent. Future studies designed to disentangle the effects of DOM attached to the MNP from the general effects of DOM in the exposure medium will contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of MNP toxicity in nature and enhance the reliability of MNP risk assessment.
